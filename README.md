A lightweight and flexible PHP rule engine supporting complex conditions and dynamic rule execution‚Äîideal for business logic evaluation and data validation.

---

## üß† Purpose & Intent

When writing PHP on a daily basis, we often encounter "conditional" business logic, such as:

- Does a certain user meet a specific condition?
- Does the current order qualify for a promotional event?
- Does a particular piece of data require further processing?

These types of logic are simple at first, just a series of if, and, or statements. But when you start dealing with 5, 10, or even dozens of conditions all tangled together, things can quickly get messy.

At first, it‚Äôs manageable, but after a while, adding, changing, or removing conditions starts to feel like defusing a bomb. Forget about handing it off to someone else ‚Äì even you, two weeks later, will look at it and cringe.

So, I spent some time developing this PHP Composer package with the goal of organizing these conditional checks in a clearer, more flexible way. The idea is to make the logic more structured and easier to reuse.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Easy to Use**: Quickly build rules with an intuitive API, supporting AND/OR combination logic.
- **Highly Extensible**: Includes common built-in operators and supports a custom operator registration mechanism to meet diverse business needs.
- **Flexible Data Structures**: Decouples rules from data, supporting multiple data formats such as arrays and objects.
- **Detailed Rule Evaluation**: Allows access to the evaluation results of each rule, making debugging and logging easier.

## üì¶ Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require hejunjie/simple-rule-engine
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

```php
use Hejunjie\SimpleRuleEngine\Rule;
use Hejunjie\SimpleRuleEngine\Engine;

// Define Rules
$rules = [
    new Rule('age', '>=', 18, 'Age must be greater than or equal to 18'),
    new Rule('country', '==', 'SG', 'Country must be Singapore'),
];

// Data to be evaluated
$data = [
    'age' => 20,
    'country' => 'SG',
];

// Evaluation Result
$result = Engine::evaluate($rules, $data, 'AND'); // Return true or false

// Get Detailed Evaluation Information
$details = Engine::evaluateWithDetails($rules, $data);
/*
Return Example:
[
    ['description' => 'Age must be greater than or equal to 18', 'passed' => true],
    ['description' => 'Country must be Singapore', 'passed' => true],
]
*/
```

You can also add custom operators through the registration mechanism.

## üîå Custom Operators

Implement the `OperatorInterface` and register through `OperatorFactory`.

```php
use Hejunjie\SimpleRuleEngine\Interface\OperatorInterface;
use Hejunjie\SimpleRuleEngine\OperatorFactory;

class CustomizeOperator implements OperatorInterface
{
    /**
     * Evaluation Method
     *
     * @param mixed $fieldValue field Value
     * @param mixed $ruleValue rule Value
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function evaluate(mixed $fieldValue, mixed $ruleValue): bool
    {
        // TODO: Implement the evaluation logic
    }

    /**
     * Operator Name
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function name(): string
    {
        return 'customize';
    }
}

// Register custom operator with customize
$factory = OperatorFactory::getInstance();
$factory->register(new CustomizeOperator());

// You can use customize when defining rules
$rules = [
    new Rule('field', 'customize', 'value', 'Custom rule description'),
    ...
    ...
];

```
